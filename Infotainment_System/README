AADL model for an Infotainment system architecture.
AADL Model has been designed using layered architectural style.

Notes/TODO:
1)Assuming the system has suitable external power supply adapter connected to the Motherboard 
of the system and thus in turn provides power to all hardware subcomponents.
Did not add a power adapter as an hardware in the considered system

2)[TODO]:Add more error handling cases for system failures and its handing.

3)[TODO]:Further divide the application software and the middle-ware software into subcomponents.

4)[TODO]:Define the response time criteria for the system.
